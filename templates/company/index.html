				Our Journey from the 
Data Center to the Cloud
			</h1>
			<h4>
				10 YEARS AGO we started with the goal to simplify consulting for enterprise technology. As we progressed, customers asked us to take it one step further and sell hardware. THEN they asked us to dedicate teams and support environments around the globe. With Cloud adoption in the enterprise growing at an unprecedented rate, timing couldn't be better for our flexible On-Premise &amp; Cloud support. TODAY we are taking everything that we've done, simplifying into its basic elements, to provide fast growing support options that are twice the value and half the cost of traditional support.
